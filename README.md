PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

This is an early project for me working with Github, React.Js, and Netlify. I want to show off a modest understanding of how github works, how it can used to host websites through netlify, and further how I know enough code to get a live static site active without using templates or page builders. 

This project employs typewriter-effect, for a simple and clean animation in the services section. 

I designed this site mobile first, using figma and wanted to keep the hero section mostly blank so that I can return to it later and add either animations or a video or slideshow.

For this project I was inspired by a number of youtube channels and videos. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s&list=FLvtWnCRl1B1-o9kl06Hl_kw&index=9. This video was probably the most helpful for this project, and honestly the inspiration for it. I followed along and copied this project to start. Later, I took what I learned from it to design my own project from scratch, trying not to copy anything directly, but instead use it as an inspiration for what I would later design.

This video was also a great inspiration for me. Particularly with making me think about adding in a border radius to a specific corner. I very much appreciated that effect. 

In this project so far, I've struggled a tiny bit trying to get netlify to install the typewriter effect, and it was pretty easy to just add it to the dependencies in the json file. I also struggled a lot with the services flex container. It was a challenge getting all the list items to sit on a level line and center themselves on the page. The issue I ran into was (I think) not having a position set to relative. And/or having something set to width:100% that shouldn't have been. 

Lasty, the cards in the service section are not finished feeling. This project is still a work in progress. I will hopefully have it more polished in the coming days or weeks.
