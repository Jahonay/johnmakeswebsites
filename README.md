John's Portfolio site

This is an early project for me working with Github, React.Js, and Netlify. I want to show off a modest understanding of how github works, how it can used to host websites through netlify.

This project employs typewriter-effect, for a simple and clean animation in the services section.

I designed this site mobile first, using figma and wanted to keep the hero section mostly blank so that I can return to it later and add either animations or a video or slideshow.

In this project so far, I've struggled a tiny bit trying to get netlify to install the typewriter effect, and it was pretty easy to just add it to the dependencies in the json file. I also struggled a lot with the services flex container. It was a challenge getting all the list items to sit on a level line and center themselves on the page. The issue I ran into was (I think) not having a position set to relative. And/or having something set to width:100% that shouldn't have been.

Lasty, the cards in the service section are not finished feeling. This project is still a work in progress. I will hopefully have it more polished in the coming days or weeks.
